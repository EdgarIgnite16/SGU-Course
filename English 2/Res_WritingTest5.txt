Hi my friend, it's a long time no see !
How is your current job ? As for me, i am quite lucky in my current job. 
I opened my own factory farming and start with it. I started raising chickens and selling raw chicken to fast food restaurants
My work sometimes difficult because of many different factors
I hope to meet you again, and if so we will meet again one day 
												Your Friend, Nguyen Loc
