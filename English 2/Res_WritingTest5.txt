Hi, my dear friend, long time no see. 
I have heard that you are intending to open a factory for farming and I see that is a great idea 
because we are currently standing in a population explosion of humans and there is not enough food for everyone. 
Your idea can help reduce food shortages caused by overpopulation and increase employment opportunities for others
                        Your best friend, Nguyen Loc
